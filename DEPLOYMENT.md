# Deployment

How to install, configure, contain and operate the OpenSCAD MCP server. For
what the tools do, see [README.md](README.md) and [API.md](API.md).

The distribution is named `openscad-mcp` and runs OpenSCAD as a subprocess, so
OpenSCAD has to be installed too.

> The PyPI distribution is `openscad-mcp`, first published as 0.6.1. Do not
> install `openscad-mcp-server`: that name belongs to an unrelated project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer (uv fetches one if you have none).
- OpenSCAD 2021.01 or newer. Development snapshots are supported and
  preferred: they carry the Manifold backend and render PNG headlessly
  through EGL, while 2021.01 needs an X display for PNG export. On 2021.01
  you therefore need a display or `xvfb` to render; mesh export, `measure`
  and `check` work without one.

### Installing OpenSCAD

| Platform | Stable | Development snapshot |
|---|---|---|
| Debian / Ubuntu | `sudo apt install openscad` | `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openscad/releases && sudo apt install openscad-nightly` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install openscad` | [copr / AppImage](https://openscad.org/downloads.html) |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S openscad` | `openscad-git` (AUR) |
| macOS | `brew install --cask openscad` | `brew install --cask openscad@snapshot` |
| Windows | [installer](https://openscad.org/downloads.html) | "Development snapshot" installer |
| Any Linux | `flatpak install flathub org.openscad.OpenSCAD` | AppImage from the downloads page |

Verify with `openscad --version`. The server probes `openscad-nightly`,
`openscad`, `OpenSCAD` and `openscad.exe` on PATH plus the usual install
locations, runs each one, and keeps the newest version it finds; set
`OPENSCAD_PATH` to override that, and call `check_openscad` to see what it
picked.

### BOSL2

BOSL2 is the library most models include, and the anchor and joint reference
tools assume it. It is found in the standard library directories and anywhere
on `OPENSCADPATH`:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2.git \
  ~/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries/BOSL2          # Linux
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2.git \
  ~/Documents/OpenSCAD/libraries/BOSL2             # macOS, Windows
```

`get_libraries` lists what the server can see.

## Installing the server

From a checkout, which is what the maintainers run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertcoop/openscad-mcp
cd openscad-mcp
uv sync --extra dev
uv run openscad-mcp
uv run openscad-mcp check examples/checks/turntable.yaml --allow .
```

Without a clone, straight from the repository:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/robertcoop/openscad-mcp openscad-mcp
uv tool install git+https://github.com/robertcoop/openscad-mcp
```

The package accepts `fastmcp>=2.14.5,<5`. A checkout uses the 2.14.5 pinned
in `uv.lock`; a fresh install resolves 4.x. Both are exercised by CI and the
server, the `check` CLI and the reference tool work on either.

## Client configuration

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add openscad --transport stdio -- uvx openscad-mcp
claude mcp add openscad --scope project \
  --env MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS=/home/me/projects \
  --transport stdio -- uvx openscad-mcp
```

To run a checkout instead, replace `uvx openscad-mcp` with
`uv run --directory /home/me/src/openscad-mcp openscad-mcp`.

`--scope local` (default) is you in this project, `--scope project` writes
`.mcp.json` for the team, `--scope user` applies everywhere.

The repository is also a Claude Code plugin, which brings the server and the
`openscad-design` skill together:

```
/plugin marketplace add robertcoop/openscad-mcp
/plugin install openscad-mcp@openscad-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop** reads `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
on macOS and `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows.
**Cursor, Windsurf and VS Code** read a project `.mcp.json`. Both take the
same shape. Any setting from the table below goes in `env`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openscad": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/home/me/src/openscad-mcp", "openscad-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENSCAD_PATH": "/usr/bin/openscad-nightly",
        "MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS": "/home/me/projects/enclosure:/home/me/projects/shared-libs",
        "MCP_MAX_MEMORY_MB": "4096",
        "MCP_RENDER_TIMEOUT": "300",
        "MCP_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That runs a checkout. For the published package, replace the command and args
with `"command": "uvx"` and `"args": ["openscad-mcp@0.6.1"]` and leave `env`
alone. `MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS` is separated by `:` on POSIX and
`;` on Windows, and must include the library directories, not just the
project. Restart the client after editing; it holds the server open.

## Configuration

Text inputs (SCAD, check files and configuration YAML) use UTF-8. UTF-8 BOMs
are accepted when reading model and YAML files; generated source and logs are UTF-8.

Every setting has an environment variable and a YAML key.
[.env.example](.env.example) is the annotated list of variables with their
defaults; a `.env` file in the working directory is loaded automatically. The
settings that matter most in a deployment:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENSCAD_PATH` | auto-detected | Binary to run |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS` | unset | Directories scripts may read, `:`-separated. Unset means no validation |
| `MCP_MAX_MEMORY_MB` | 4096 | `RLIMIT_AS` per OpenSCAD process on POSIX; 0 disables |
| `MCP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` | 300 | Seconds before a subprocess is killed |
| `MCP_MAX_CONCURRENT_RENDERS` | 5 | Simultaneous OpenSCAD processes |
| `MCP_MAX_IMAGE_WIDTH` / `_HEIGHT` | 1568 | Requested sizes are clamped, aspect preserved |
| `MCP_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` | 10 | Largest inline `scad_content` accepted |
| `MCP_HARD_WARNINGS` | false | Restores `--hardwarnings`; see the README for why it is off |
| `MCP_CACHE_ENABLED` / `_SIZE_MB` / `_TTL_HOURS` | true / 500 / 24 | Render cache |
| `MCP_TEMP_DIR` | `<system temp>/openscad-mcp` | Scratch directory; uses Python's `tempfile.gettempdir()` on each host |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` / `MCP_HOST` / `MCP_PORT` | stdio / localhost / 8000 | Transport |
| `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` / `MCP_LOG_FILE` | INFO / none | Logging; the file handler rotates |

The same keys nest in YAML under `server`, `rendering`, `cache`, `security`
and `logging`, loaded with `Config.from_yaml`. YAML is the only way to move
the cache directory; there is no environment variable for it.

## Running as a service

stdio is the default transport and needs no service: the client starts the
process and owns its lifetime. A long-lived service only makes sense for the
`http` transport, which serves MCP at `http://HOST:PORT/mcp`.

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/openscad-mcp.service
[Unit]
Description=OpenSCAD MCP Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=openscad-mcp
Group=openscad-mcp
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/openscad-mcp
Environment=MCP_TRANSPORT=http
Environment=MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1
Environment=MCP_PORT=8000
Environment=MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS=/var/lib/openscad-mcp/projects
Environment=MCP_MAX_CONCURRENT_RENDERS=4
Environment=MCP_TEMP_DIR=/var/lib/openscad-mcp/tmp
Environment=HOME=/var/lib/openscad-mcp
ExecStart=/opt/openscad-mcp/bin/openscad-mcp
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true
ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/openscad-mcp

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Install into a virtualenv the service user owns:

```bash
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/openscad-mcp
sudo /opt/openscad-mcp/bin/pip install openscad-mcp
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now openscad-mcp
journalctl -u openscad-mcp -f
```

`HOME` matters: the render cache is written to `$HOME/.cache/openscad-mcp`.
On OpenSCAD 2021.01 add `Environment=DISPLAY=:99` and a companion Xvfb unit,
or renders will fail while everything else keeps working. Bind to 127.0.0.1
and put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front if the port has to leave the
host; the server itself does no authentication.

## Docker

[Dockerfile](Dockerfile) builds a Debian image with OpenSCAD 2021.01, Xvfb and
BOSL2. The default target installs the checkout; `release` installs a
published version from PyPI.

```bash
docker build -t openscad-mcp .
docker build --target release --build-arg OPENSCAD_MCP_VERSION=0.6.1 -t openscad-mcp:rel .

docker run --rm -i -v "$PWD:/work" openscad-mcp                 # stdio server
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" openscad-mcp check checks.yaml  # one check run
```

The entrypoint starts Xvfb and then `exec`s the server, so the server is PID 1
and the exit code survives. `xvfb-run` is deliberately not used: as PID 1 it
never reaps its child and the container hangs after the command finishes.
`MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS=/work` is set in the image, so the mounted project is the
only thing a script can read.

Mount a volume at `/home/mcp/.cache/openscad-mcp` to keep the cache between
runs. To use the image as the MCP server, set the client's `command` to
`docker` and its `args` to
`["run", "--rm", "-i", "-v", "/home/me/projects:/work", "openscad-mcp"]`.

## Security hardening

The threat model is in the README and is worth reading before exposing this to
anything untrusted. In deployment terms:

- **Set `MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS`.** Unset, no path validation happens at all and
  the server logs a warning saying so. Set, both the arguments (`scad_file`,
  `include_paths`, export `output_path`) and the whole dependency closure
  OpenSCAD actually read are checked, and output is withheld if anything falls
  outside. That closes `include <...>` and `surface(file=...)` as ways to read
  arbitrary files.
- **Keep the memory ceiling.** `MCP_MAX_MEMORY_MB` applies `RLIMIT_AS` per
  OpenSCAD process on POSIX hosts. OpenSCAD has none of its own, and a small
  `minkowski()` can consume the whole machine. `MCP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` bounds
  every subprocess.
- Echo output is capped at 200 lines of 2000 characters and labelled as
  untrusted content from the rendered file.
- There is **no OS-level sandbox**: no network isolation, no filesystem
  namespace. For untrusted input use the container above, or Landlock or
  bubblewrap with only the project directory visible.
- Run as a dedicated unprivileged user, and give the HTTP transport a reverse
  proxy rather than a public port.

## Cache and disk use

Everything is cached under `~/.cache/openscad-mcp`: rendered PNGs with their
dependency manifests at the top level, per-part meshes and CSG dumps in
`parts/`. Keys cover everything that went into the call, so an ordinary edit
invalidates the entry.

`MCP_CACHE_SIZE_MB` (500) covers render files and the `parts/` STL, JSON and
CSG files. Eviction removes the oldest entries as groups, keeping meshes and
their manifests together. `MCP_CACHE_TTL_HOURS` (24) applies to render lookups;
part entries are bounded by size rather than TTL. Inspect disk usage with:

```bash
du -sh ~/.cache/openscad-mcp ~/.cache/openscad-mcp/parts
```

The `clear_cache` tool removes both disk caches and clears in-memory measurements
and mesh acceleration data, including when caching has been disabled or the cache
directory is absent. Deleting disk files alone does not clear process memory.
Dependency hashes detect content edits even when file size and timestamps remain
unchanged. Static dependency scans for measurements/parts cannot resolve every
computed filename; clear caches explicitly after changing such inputs.
`MCP_TEMP_DIR` holds scratch files for inline models and should be on fast local disk.

## Upgrading

```bash
git -C /home/me/src/openscad-mcp pull && uv sync --extra dev   # a checkout
uv tool upgrade openscad-mcp                                   # uv tool install
uvx openscad-mcp@latest                                        # newest release
pip install --upgrade openscad-mcp
```

`uvx` caches by version, so a client configured as `uvx openscad-mcp` keeps
running the cached build until you upgrade or ask for `@latest`; a Git install
caches by commit, and `uvx --refresh` re-resolves it. Restart the client
afterwards. To roll back, pin the previous version and restart.

## Checks in CI

`openscad-mcp check` runs a check file without a client and exits 0 when
everything passes, 1 on any FAIL, 2 when only unresolved rows remain, and 3 on
an error. [examples/checks/turntable.yaml](examples/checks/turntable.yaml) is
an annotated file exercising every rule.

```make
# Makefile
CHECKS  := $(wildcard checks/*.yaml)
OSCHECK := uvx openscad-mcp@0.6.1

.PHONY: check
check:
	@for f in $(CHECKS); do \
	    echo "== $$f"; \
	    $(OSCHECK) check $$f --allow $(CURDIR) || exit $$?; \
	done

.PHONY: check-json
check-json:
	@$(OSCHECK) check checks/assembly.yaml --allow $(CURDIR) --json > check-report.json
```

`--model FILE` points the same rules at another `.scad`, `--fn N` overrides
tessellation, `--allow DIR` is repeatable. In a GitHub Actions job, install
OpenSCAD with `sudo apt-get install -y openscad xvfb` and run `make check`;
mesh-based rules need no display.

## Troubleshooting

**"OpenSCAD not found" at startup.** The server logs this and keeps running,
because the read-only tools still work. Run `which openscad` and set
`OPENSCAD_PATH` to the absolute path. On macOS it is inside the bundle:
`/Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD`.

**Renders fail but `measure` and `check` work.** That is the display problem
on 2021.01. Run under `xvfb-run -a openscad-mcp`, set `DISPLAY` to a real
one, or install a development snapshot, which renders through EGL.

**Blank images or truncated echo output.** `--hardwarnings` stops evaluation
at the first warning while still exiting 0. It is off by default; if you set
`MCP_HARD_WARNINGS=true`, this is why.

**"outside allowed paths".** The file, one of `include_paths`, or something
the model read through `include`/`use`/`import`/`surface` is not under
`MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS`. Containment uses resolved paths, so a symlink into the
directory does not count. Add the real directory, libraries included.

**Stale results after editing a file.** The cache key covers the model and
its dependency manifest, so ordinary edits invalidate it. If something is
genuinely stuck, call `clear_cache` or delete `~/.cache/openscad-mcp`.

**Client shows no tools.** Run the exact command from the config in a
terminal. It must print nothing on stdout: on the stdio transport stdout is
the JSON-RPC channel, and a stray print breaks the handshake. Set
`MCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and `MCP_LOG_FILE` to capture the startup logs.
