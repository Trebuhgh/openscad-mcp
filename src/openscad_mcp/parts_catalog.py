"""Catalog of purchased ("vitamin") parts, with a BOSL2 module for each.

A language model designing a bracket needs to know how big the motor is, where
its screws go and which way its shaft points. Guessing produces a bracket that
does not fit. This module ships a small number of thoroughly sourced parts, each
paired with a generated OpenSCAD file under ``parts/`` that provides three
modules:

``part_<id>()``
    The part as purchased, a BOSL2 ``attachable()`` with named anchors on the
    features you mate to: ``mount-plane``, ``shaft-axis``, ``hole-a`` and so on.
``part_<id>_mask(clr, bore_clr, install, install_len)``
    The negative: the pocket the part sits in, with separate running clearance
    on flat body faces and bore clearance on round features, plus an optional
    straight-line install sweep so the part can be put in and taken out.
``part_<id>_mount_holes_mask(d, h)``
    Just the screw holes, kept separate so the caller picks tap, clearance or
    heat-set diameter.

All three share one coordinate frame, so the same ``anchor=`` argument puts the
solid, its pocket and its screw holes in the same place.

Data policy, which is the point of this module:

* Every dimension carries a ``source`` and a ``confidence`` (the same
  ``standard`` / ``consensus`` / ``calibrate`` labels the ``reference`` module
  uses).
* A number nobody publishes does not get invented. It goes in the entry's
  ``verify`` list, which is not optional and is never empty, and the OpenSCAD
  file exposes it as a parameter you can override after you measure your part.
* Dimensions are facts and are not copyrightable. The generated modules are
  original work, MIT licensed with the rest of openscad-mcp.
