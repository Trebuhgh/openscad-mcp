"""
Structured interpretation of OpenSCAD process output.

OpenSCAD's exit code is not a reliable success signal. On 2021.01 a failed
``assert()``, a call to an unknown module, a non-closed polyhedron and a
missing include all exit 0 while printing their diagnostic to stderr, so
every tool path has to read stderr rather than trust the return code. This
module turns that stream into structured records, extracts the CGAL
statistics banner into a mesh-health summary, attaches repair hints keyed to
message strings OpenSCAD actually emits, and parses the Makefile-style
dependency file written by ``-d``.
