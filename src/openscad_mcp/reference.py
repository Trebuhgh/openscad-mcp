"""Static engineering reference data for OpenSCAD part design.

This module ships sourced engineering numbers so that a language model designing
parts does not have to invent fit clearances, fastener dimensions or bearing
sizes from memory. Everything is hard-coded; nothing is read from disk at
runtime.

Every entry carries a ``confidence`` label:

``standard``
    Taken from a published standard or a manufacturer catalogue. The number is
    what the standard says.
``consensus``
    Widely used community practice with no governing standard. Reasonable
    default, not authoritative.
``calibrate``
    The honest answer is "print a test coupon". The number is a starting point
    only and will move with printer, material and slicer settings.

_CONVENTIONS_BRIEF = """\
Modelling conventions (OpenSCAD, this server):
- Units are millimetres. Z is up, right-handed, XY is the build plate.
- Put the part origin at a meaningful datum, normally bottom-centre (centred in X and Y, \
base at Z=0), and state the datum in a comment.
- One module per physical part, with a `part` parameter or separate named modules, so any \
one part or the whole assembly can be rendered.
- Overlap coplanar boundaries in union/difference by an epsilon of 0.01 mm; extend cutting \
solids past both faces. Never inset: exact coincidence gives non-manifold geometry.
- Declare every key dimension as a commented top-level variable. No magic numbers in \
geometry.
- Make clearance an explicit named variable, e.g. `clearance = 0.15; // per side`. If BOSL2 \
is available, set `$slop` once instead and let its modules apply it (BOSL2 applies $slop per \
side; its default is 0).
- $fn moderately: 24 while iterating, 64+ for final renders and export.
- Prefer `include <BOSL2/std.scad>` when BOSL2 is installed.
- echo() the assumptions and derived sizes; assert() the constraints that must hold.
- Check results with the measurement tool, not by judging the rendered picture.
"""

_CHEATSHEET_TEXT = """\
OpenSCAD reminders (things that are commonly got wrong):
- Variables are compile-time. The LAST assignment in a scope wins for the whole scope. You
  cannot accumulate in a for loop; use a list comprehension, recursion, or let().
- for() instantiates children per value and UNIONS them. Use intersection_for() to intersect.
- difference() keeps child 1 and subtracts all later children. Order matters.
- center: cube/square/cylinder default center=false (positive octant / on Z=0); sphere is
  always centred. center=true centres on the origin.
- Transforms (translate/rotate/mirror/scale) apply innermost-first: translate() rotate()
  cube() rotates, then translates. rotate() is in degrees, applied X then Y then Z.
  mirror(v) reflects across the plane through the origin normal to v; it does not translate.
- hull() = convex hull, the cheap rounded-slot trick. minkowski() rounds but is very slow.
- linear_extrude(height, center, convexity, twist, slices, scale) and
  rotate_extrude(angle, convexity); the rotate_extrude child must lie in X>=0.
- offset(r=) rounds corners, offset(delta=) keeps them sharp, offset(delta=, chamfer=true)
  chamfers. 2D only.
- projection() flattens the silhouette; projection(cut=true) sections at Z=0.
- Modifiers: % background (excluded), # highlight (kept), ! render only this subtree,
  * disable. Remove % and # before export.
- assert(cond, "msg") enforces design constraints; echo() reports computed values.
- let(a=1) binds for one child. List comprehensions: [for (i=[0:5]) i*2], with if/let.
  each flattens a nested list.
- is_undef(x) tests an unset variable; also is_num, is_string, is_list, is_bool.
- $fn overrides $fa (min angle, default 12) and $fs (min size, default 2). Prefer setting it
  per object: cylinder(r=5, $fn=64).
- import("f.stl", convexity=10): without adequate convexity, preview shows holes.
- text() needs a font installed; a missing font falls back silently and changes size.
- 2D and 3D cannot be mixed in a boolean. Extrude first, or use projection().
