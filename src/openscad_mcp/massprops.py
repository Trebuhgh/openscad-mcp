"""Exact mass properties from a triangle soup.

Volume, centre of mass and the full inertia tensor of a closed triangle mesh,
computed by signed-tetrahedron decomposition. Everything here is standard
library only and single pass, so an 86k-triangle export is integrated in about
0.05 s -- an order of magnitude less than parsing the STL that produced it.

Three things make the numbers trustworthy rather than merely plausible:

* **Integration about the bounding-box centre.** A part modelled at
  ``[1000, 2000, 3000]`` shows products of inertia around 1e-6 relative where
  symmetry says exactly zero, because the tetrahedra are then huge compared to
  the part. Shifting to the bbox centre first and translating the result back
  drives those to ~1e-17.
* **A watertightness flag, not a silent answer.** Deleting 40 facets from a
  1208-triangle mesh moves its volume by 58% with no error anywhere. The flag
  is reported; refusing or warning is the caller's decision.
* **Exact composition.** Per-part results combine through the parallel-axis
  theorem, so an assembly never needs a whole-assembly export and per-part
  material or mass overrides stay exact.

Typical use::

    mp = mass_properties(load_stl("platform.stl"), material="PLA")
    j = mp.inertia_about_axis((0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1))   # g*mm^2 about the Z axis

    Each triangle forms a tetrahedron with a reference point; the signed volumes
